[Leetcode Subscribed Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-univalue-subtrees/)

---

Given a binary tree, count the number of uni-value subtrees.

A Uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

**Example:**
```
Input:  root = [5,1,5,5,5,null,5]

              5
             / \
            1   5
           / \   \
          5   5   5

Output: 4
```
