Given a list of words and two words *word1* and *word2*, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
```
Input: _word1_ = “coding”, _word2_ = “practice”
Output: 3

Input: _word1_ = "makes", _word2_ = "coding"
