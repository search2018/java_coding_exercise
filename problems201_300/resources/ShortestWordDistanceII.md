### Leetcode 244. Shortest Word Distance II
[Leetcode Subscribed Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii/)

---

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words *word1* and *word2* and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called  repeatedly  many times with different parameters. 

**Example:**
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
```
Input: _word1_ = “coding”, _word2_ = “practice”
Output: 3

Input: _word1_ = "makes", _word2_ = "coding"
Output: 1
```

**Note:**
You may assume that *word1* does not equal to *word2*, and *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.
