### Leetcode 272. Closest Binary Search Tree Value II
[Leetcode Subscribed Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-binary-search-tree-value-ii/)

---

Given a non-empty binary search tree and a target value, find *k* values in the BST that are closest to the target.

**Note:**

- Given target value is a floating point.
- You may assume *k* is always valid, that is: `k â‰¤ total` nodes.
- You are guaranteed to have only one unique set of  k  values in the BST that are closest to the target.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [4,2,5,1,3], target = 3.714286, and _k_ = 2

    4
   / \
  2   5
 / \
1   3

Output: [4,3]
```

**Follow up:**
Assume that the BST is balanced, could you solve it in less than  *O(n)* runtime (where *n* = total nodes)?
