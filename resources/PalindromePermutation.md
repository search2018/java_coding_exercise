[Leetcode Subscribed Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-permutation/)

---

Given a string, determine if a permutation of the string could form a palindrome.

Example 1:
```
Input: "code"
Output: false
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "aab"
Output: true
```
Example 3:
```
Input: "carerac"
Output: true
```

Hint:
<ol>
<li>Consider the palindromes of odd vs even length. What difference do you notice?</li>
<li>Count the frequency of each character.</li>
<li>If each character occurs even number of times, then it must be a palindrome. How about character which occurs odd number of times?</li>
</ol>
