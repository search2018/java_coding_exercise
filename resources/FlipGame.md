### Leetcode 293. Flip Game
[Leetcode Subscribed Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game/)

---

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip twoconsecutive `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

**Example**
```
given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
```

**Note:**
If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.
