[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game/)

---

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: `+` and `-`, you and your friend take turns to flip twoconsecutive `"++"` into `"--"`. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.

<strong>Example</strong>
```
given `s = "++++"`, after one move, it may become one of the following states:
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
```
<strong>Note:</strong>
If there is no valid move, return an empty list `[]`.
