Subscribed Problem
[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/verify-preorder-sequence-in-binary-search-tree/)

---

Given an array of numbers, verify whether it is the correct preorder traversal sequence of a binary search tree.

You may assume each number in the sequence is unique.

Consider the following binary search tree: 
```
     5
    / \
   2   6
  / \
 1   3
```
<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: [5,2,6,1,3]
Output: false
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: [5,2,1,3,6]
Output: true
```
<strong>Follow up:</strong>
Could you do it using only constant space complexity?
