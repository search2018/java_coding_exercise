Given a list of words and two words *word1* and *word2* , return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

*word1* and *word2*  may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
```
Input: _word1_ = “makes”, _word2_ = “coding”
Output: 1

Input: _word1_ = "makes", _word2_ = "makes"
Output: 3
```
Note:
You may assume *word1* and *word2* are both in the list.
