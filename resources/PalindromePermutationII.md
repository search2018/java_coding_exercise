### Leetcode 156. Binary Tree Upside Down
[Leetcode Subscribed Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-permutation-ii/)

---


Given a string `s`, return all the palindromic permutations (without duplicates) of it. Return an empty list if no palindromic permutation could be form.

Example 1:
```
Input: "aabb"
Output: ["abba", "baab"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: "abc"
Output: []
```

Hint:

1. If a palindromic permutation exists, we just need to generate the first half of the string.
1. To generate all distinct permutations of a (half of) string, use a similar approach from: [Permutations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii) or [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation).
