### Leetcode 2291. Word Pattern II
Subscribed Problem
[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-pattern-ii/)

---

Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if strfollows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a letter in `pattern` and a non-empty substring in `str`.

<strong>Example 1:</strong>
```
Input: pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue"
Output: true
```
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
```
Input: pattern = pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd"
Output: true
```
<strong>Example 3:</strong>
```
Input: pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc"
Output: false
```
<strong>Notes:</strong>
You may assume both `pattern` and `str` contains only lowercase letters.
