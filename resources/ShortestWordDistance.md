[Leetcode link](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance/)

---

Given a list of words and two words <em>word1</em> and <em>word2</em>, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

Example:
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.
```
Input: _word1_ = “coding”, _word2_ = “practice”
Output: 3

Input: _word1_ = "makes", _word2_ = "coding"
Output: 1
```
Note:
You may assume that <em>word1</em> does not equal to <em>word2</em> , and <em>word1</em> and <em>word2</em> are both in the list.
